Fingerprint Classification Model
Overview

This project involves a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying fingerprint images. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and is trained on grayscale images of fingerprints. It utilizes edge detection with the Canny algorithm to preprocess images before classification. The project includes code for loading data, preprocessing images, training the model, and making predictions on test images.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Uses the Canny edge detection algorithm to preprocess fingerprint images.
Model Training: Trains a CNN to classify fingerprint images into different categories.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on test data.
Model Saving and Loading: Saves and loads the trained model and label encoder for inference.
Inference: Makes predictions on new fingerprint images and displays results.
Tech Stack
TensorFlow: For building and training the CNN model.
Keras: High-level API used for model creation and training.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
Scikit-Learn: For label encoding and data splitting.
Joblib: For saving and loading the label encoder.
